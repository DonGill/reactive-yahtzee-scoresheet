# About
The Reactive Yahtzee Scoresheet project is a personal playground application to learn ReactJS. I am adding functionality as I learn new concepts. 

## Current Functionality
 - (12/5/2018) - rendering the single dice and single dice score component sections.


## Hitlist
 - update single dice section to mimic original yahtzee scoresheet (just black lines on a white background.
 - render lower score section
 - render game grand total
 - implement multiple yahtzee bonuses
 - implement crossout gameplay action

## Bootstrapped by Create React App 
Thanks to the good folks at Facebook who provided the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap this application.

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
