# About
The Reactive Yahtzee Scoresheet project is a personal playground application to learn ReactJS. I am adding functionality as I learn new concepts. 

## Current Functionality
 - (12/13/2018) - rendering grand totals of game.
 - (12/10/2018) - rendering combinations section from state, but haven't completely solved the select elements. Added item to hitlist. 
 - (12/7/2018) - created new yahtzee.css to update the single dice section to mimic original Yahtzee scoresheet, but kept my favorite color right now: tomatoe.
 - (12/5/2018) - rendering the single dice and single dice score component sections.


## Hitlist
 - design problem: there are actually several value ranges that will need to be handled in the individual comboboxes. These shouldn't change, so I will add the ranges to the base state? Give it a try
 - wire up onchange of individual select elements to update game state
 - figure out how to style a select element.
 - implement multiple yahtzee bonuses
 - implement crossout gameplay action

## Bootstrapped by Create React App 
Thanks to the good folks at Facebook who provided the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap this application.
